This is the companion code to my article published in Towards Data Science:

[Quantum Computing for Optimization Problems â€” Solving the Knapsack Problem](https://towardsdatascience.com/quantum-computing-for-optimization-problems-solving-the-knapsack-problem-274f01e78ed8)

The main notebook with the entire code used in the article is [ks-comparison.ipynb](./ks-comparison.ipynb).

The dataset is self-generated by the code, and can be inspected at [ds.csv](./ds.csv).

This folder also includes images and mathematical formulae used in the article.
